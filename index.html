						What does it mean to love life? How does one "love infinitely, and live eternally"?
					</p>
					<p>
						To love infinitely is to love wholeheartedly, with every intent, with every decision, with every action, with every expression, with every word. To have love is to have compassion and understanding.  To be in love is to serve in all capacity, at all times, in every way. Love values all things. In love, there is acceptance of what was, is, and will be, and allows for all to exist in harmony. Due to love, there is prosperity, evolution, and peace. When love is present, there is no condemnation. To have love is to have no fear. Love promotes all. Love desires nothing in return. Love triumphs over all.
					</p>
					<p>
						To live eternally is to know that from the dust of the earth comes life, and life returns to the earth as dust. Consider the lives of the past, and learn from their ways. Live in respect to all that exists now, being mindful that even the lifeless things around us are necessary for life. Contemplate life that is yet to come, and produce life. Preserve life, and encourage livelihood. Live in the awareness of the fraility of life.
